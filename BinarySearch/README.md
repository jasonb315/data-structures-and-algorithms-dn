# Linked List
#### *Author: Jason Burns*

------------------------------

## Description
In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference to the next node in the sequence. -wikipediam
