#### *Author: Jason Burns*

------------------------------

## QUEUE

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the and the. A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a binary tree is a tuple, where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set. Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well.

## Binary Tree

| Method | Summary | Big O Time | Big O Space | Example | 
| :----------- | :----------- | :-------------: | :-------------: | :----------- |
| Peek | Looks at and returns the head of the structure without mutating it | O(1) | O(1) | myStack.Peek() |
| Push | Place a new Node with data at the top of the stack | O(1) | O(1) | myStack.Push(oject) |
| Pop | Removes a Node fro mthe top of the stack and returns it's data | O(1) | O(1) | myStack.Pop() |

## Binary Search Tree

| Method | Summary | Big O Time | Big O Space | Example | 
| :----------- | :----------- | :-------------: | :-------------: | :----------- |
| Add |  Conditionally places new node in tree based on given ID val | O(log n) | O(1) | tree.Add(x) |
| Contains | conditionally walks down tree checking for value match | O(h) | O(1) | tree.contains(x) |
